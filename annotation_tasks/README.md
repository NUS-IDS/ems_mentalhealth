<b>Evaluation 1</b> <br>
For the Upworker, we shared the treatment suggestions from Step-2 and Responses generated in Step-3 via an excel file.
The annotator has a verified account and has a masters degree in Clincial Psychology. She was paid USD 50 for annotating
the set of 22 questions in our dataset.

<b>Evaluation 2</b> AMT workers were chosen based on a qualification test based on EMS labels. Only annotators who scored at least
80\% of the ten MH questions correctly, based on the schema definitions were able to rate the responses.

They were paid USD 0.6 per assignment (HIT) for providing the ratings along the four dimensions above (as well as how personal the response sounds).
Sample Snapshots are included.

On the AMT platform, we required the crowdworkers to have greater than 98% HIT approval rate, a
minimum of 10,000 HITs, be located in the United States, and obtain 80\% or above on 
EMS based qualification.
