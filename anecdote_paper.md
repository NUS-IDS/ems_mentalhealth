Question Text:

My relationship feels off and I feel insecure  My girlfriend's grandma passed away 5 months ago. 
They were very close. She took care of her till she died. Things kinda returned to normal few weeks later. 
Last month it feels like we hit a brick wall. Intimacy fell off. I asked what's up. 
She says she can't connect with anyone and that it's not me. She used to be very open and expressive. 
Now she gives short answers and has no interest in sex or any touching. When we did have sex in the last month, 
something felt really off. Now I'm very insecure about us and have thoughts of her cheating. She says otherwise, 
but I don't know. It just feels like something is really off.

Use learned assertion skills.

3. List traumas that involved abuse to you. If it is too difficult to create a list, tell a therapist

<b>Known-counselor response (Ground Truth):
</b>
Grief has a huge impact on us and everyone's reaction is different. The one common reaction however is to shut 
down and distance ourselves. Her relationship with her grandmother was close, given she took care of her up 
until she passed. It sounds like she is working through a difficult loss and her ability to connect with you,
or anyone else, is likely low right now. Trust what she is telling you and try to be there for her as she works 
through it. If she finds it too difficult to connect again, a good grief counselor can help her get back on track.

<b>Response from STeer:</b>

and your girlfriend to seek support from a therapist or counselor to navigate through this challenging time. 

In the meantime, I would encourage you to consider the suggestions provided to think about trustworthiness, 
slowly allow others to get close to you, and address any past traumas that may be impacting your 
current feelings of insecurity. It's important to communicate openly and honestly with your girlfriend about 
your concerns and to try to support each other through this difficult period. Remember to practice self-care
and be patient with yourself and your girlfriend as you navigate through these emotions together.

<b>Response from GPT 3.5 Turbo </b>

I'm sorry to hear that you're going through a difficult time in your relationship. It sounds like your 
girlfriend is still grieving the loss of her grandmother and is having a hard time connecting with others, 
including you. Grief can have a profound impact on a person's emotions and behaviors, and it's not
uncommon for someone to withdraw or have difficulty with intimacy after experiencing a significant loss.

It's important to communicate openly and honestly with your girlfriend about your feelings and concerns,
but also try to approach the situation with empathy and understanding. It's possible that her behavior is not 
related to you or your relationship, but rather her own internal struggles with grief and loss.

I would encourage you to continue to support and be there for your girlfriend during this difficult time. 
Encourage her to seek support from a therapist or counselor who can help her navigate her feelings and emotions. 
Remember that it's okay to feel insecure or worried, but try to approach the situation with patience and compassion. 
Take care of yourself as well and consider seeking support for yourself if needed.
