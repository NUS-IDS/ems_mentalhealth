1. Embrace the idea that people may come and go in your life, but that doesn't mean they will all eventually leave you, die, or act unpredictably. Challenge any exaggerated thoughts you may have about this.

2. Take note of how you react when you're temporarily separated from others. Try your best to remain calm and avoid blowing the situation out of proportion.

3. Let go of the unrealistic expectation that people should always be available to you and completely consistent with you. Recognize that they have their own lives and boundaries.

4. Understand that it's perfectly okay for others to set limits and have their own personal space. Learn to accept and respect their need for independence.

5. Be mindful of any behaviors you may engage in to ensure that people stay in your life. Instead, focus on building healthy relationships based on trust and mutual respect.

6. Challenge the belief that you must always do what others want in order to prevent them from leaving you. Remember that your own needs and desires are just as important.

7. Make a conscious effort to choose partners who are capable of making a commitment to you. Allow yourself to feel more at ease in stable and secure relationships.

8. Stop pushing your partners away with jealousy, clinginess, anger, or controlling behaviors. Instead, cultivate a sense of trust and open communication in your relationships.

9. If you find yourself in an unstable relationship, consider walking away sooner rather than later. Learn to tolerate being alone and focus on your own well-being.

10. Take some time to reflect on instances of abandonment you may have experienced in your life, particularly during childhood. Work on releasing any negative emotions and self-perceptions that may have stemmed from those events.
