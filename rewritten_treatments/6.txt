1. Think about all the everyday tasks, situations, responsibilities, and decisions that you rely on others for. Reflect on how much you depend on them and how it makes you feel.

2. Take a moment to consider the challenges, changes, or phobias that you've been avoiding because they scare you. Acknowledge them and think about how overcoming them could benefit you.

3. Start pushing yourself to tackle everyday tasks and decisions without constantly seeking help. Begin with the easier ones to build your confidence and gradually move on to more challenging ones.

4. Embrace the idea that you are capable of functioning without constant assistance from others. Remind yourself that you have the power to handle things on your own.

5. Work on increasing your independence by actively problem-solving and making decisions by yourself. Celebrate your accomplishments and don't give up if you fail at something. Remember, it's all part of the learning process.

6. Challenge the notion that depending on others is the ideal way to live. Reflect on how this dependency can negatively impact your life and hold you back from reaching your full potential.

7. Recognize that excessive dependence on others limits your ability to express yourself fully. Consider the ways in which this limited self-expression could harm your life and hinder your personal growth.

8. Take the time to learn relaxation, meditation, or other anxiety-reducing techniques. These techniques will help you manage the stress that may arise as you strive for independence.

9. If your family members encourage your dependent behaviors, have a conversation with them about your desire to become more independent. Also, avoid complaining if your partner or boss doesn't provide as much help as you'd like. Focus on taking responsibility for your own actions.

10. Create a list of behaviors that gradually lead to more independence. As you work on this list, practice your relaxation techniques to stay calm and focused.

11. Take the time to reprocess negative experiences from your past, especially those involving overprotective parents. Deal with any current "failures" that may be holding you back from embracing independence. Remember, every setback is an opportunity for growth.
