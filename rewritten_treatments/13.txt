1. Take a moment to reflect on whether you tend to see others as fragile and needy. Consider if this perception might be exaggerated and try to recognize it.

2. Take some time to focus on your own needs by making a list of them. Pay special attention to your need for support, understanding, protection, and guidance.

3. Evaluate your relationships and see if there is a fair balance of giving and taking. While there may be situations where caretaking is necessary, overall the balance should be relatively equal over time.

4. Allow yourself to express your sadness and anger about unmet emotional needs through imagery. Confront those who have deprived you and let your emotions be heard.

5. Reflect on whether you were ever treated as a "parentified child," where adults placed adult responsibilities on you during your childhood. Acknowledge the memories and emotions associated with losing your childhood because of this. Work on reducing negative feelings and self-perceptions related to these experiences.

6. Use imagery as a way to release your anger towards those who have intentionally deprived you or demanded too much from you.

7. Don't be afraid to ask for what you need directly. If there are changes that need to be made for your well-being, present yourself in a clear and assertive manner.

8. Choose partners and friends who are capable and giving, rather than those who are incapable or overly demanding. Set boundaries on how much you give to others.

9. Challenge yourself to occasionally be vulnerable with others instead of always being the "strong one." Allow yourself to show your emotions and ask for support when needed.

10. Avoid making excuses for constantly trying to please others. Remember that it's important to prioritize your own well-being and not always prioritize the needs of others.
