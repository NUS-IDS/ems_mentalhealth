1. Take a moment to reflect on areas where you might be a little too strict or demanding with yourself. It's important to find balance in your standards.

2. Instead of thinking in absolutes, consider a wide range of performance levels, from poor to perfect, with plenty of room for variation in between. Take the time to decide where you want to fall on this spectrum for each task.

3. Take a moment to weigh the pros and cons of holding onto unrelenting standards. Ask yourself, "What would be the benefits and drawbacks if I were to do things a little less perfectly?" Make a list of your findings.

4. Explore the advantages and disadvantages of your high standards. Think about how lowering them could positively impact your health and happiness, as well as how maintaining them might be damaging your enjoyment of life and relationships with others.

5. Remind yourself that imperfection is not a crime and making mistakes doesn't always have the negative consequences you fear.

6. Give yourself permission to do less and intentionally do tasks with a bit less precision. Notice how setting lower standards allows you to focus on enjoying time with loved ones and enhancing the quality of your relationships.

7. Pay attention to how these suggested changes make you feel. Notice any shifts in your overall well-being and satisfaction.

8. Release any guilt you may feel when you don't put in your usual maximum effort. Remember that it's perfectly acceptable to embrace imperfection at times.
