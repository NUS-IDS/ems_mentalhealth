1. Take a moment to reflect on your own personal preferences and inclinations. Instead of trying to please others, focus on what truly brings you joy and fulfillment.

2. Dare to question the notion that being intertwined with others is always better than having your own unique identity. Take the time to list and delve into the advantages and disadvantages of developing your own individuality.

3. Take a closer look at yourself and your parental figure(s). Identify both the similarities and differences between you and them, understanding how these dynamics shape your own identity.

4. Surround yourself with partners and friends who appreciate and encourage your independence, rather than those who stifle it. Seek relationships that both respect and challenge your individuality.

5. Embark on a journey to explore and discover experiences that inherently bring you joy. Reflect on your preferences in music, movies, books, food, and activities, and make a list of all the things that truly resonate with your soul.

6. Take a moment to reevaluate past disagreements with your parents. Release any negative thoughts and self-perceptions that may have stemmed from these experiences. Allow yourself to process and let go of any lingering resentment, focusing instead on personal growth and understanding.
