1. Take a moment to challenge any thoughts that you may have about being defective. Look at the evidence for and against this idea, and see if you can find a different perspective.

2. Make a list of all your personal assets and qualities that you love about yourself. Focus on these to help reduce the significance you give to any perceived flaws.

3. Remember that many of our so-called flaws are actually behaviors we learned in childhood and can be changed. Take the time to learn and grow from them.

4. Recognize that thoughts of defectiveness often come from the critical words of others. Remind yourself that these perceptions may not be accurate or fair.

5. Think back to any memories of criticism from your parents. Work on letting go of the negative emotions and self-perceptions that were created by this criticism.

6. Surround yourself with relationships that uplift and support you. Nurture these connections and allow them to enhance your positive self-perceptions.

7. Choose partners who truly love and accept you for who you are. Seek out relationships that are supportive rather than critical.

8. When faced with criticism, find a balance. Accept valid criticism and make changes if necessary. However, if you know that the criticism is false, affirm to yourself internally that it does not define you.

9. Set boundaries with critical people and refuse to tolerate any form of maltreatment. You deserve to be treated with respect and kindness.

10. Open up to the people you trust. Share your thoughts and feelings with them, and allow their acceptance to help you overcome any feelings of defectiveness.

11. Take steps to decrease any overcompensating behaviors, such as trying to appear perfect, achieving excessively, demeaning others, or competing for status. Embrace your true self and let go of the need for external validation.
