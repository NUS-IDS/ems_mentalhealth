1. Take a moment to reflect on times when you feel fearful and overly cautious about potential abuse. Make a list of these instances to better understand your feelings.

2. Embrace a wide range of trustworthiness in others and use this perspective to guide your actions. Start consciously trusting those who have proven themselves deserving of your trust.

3. Remember that you are not responsible for things that are not your fault. Avoid making excuses for someone's abusive behavior and place blame where it truly belongs.

4. Equip yourself with effective ways to express anger and other strong negative emotions. Learn proper assertion skills to vent these feelings in a healthy and appropriate manner.

5. Gradually develop trust in honest individuals. Show this trust by opening up and sharing appropriate details about yourself, secrets, and memories with a close friend or partner.

6. Surround yourself with non-abusive friends and partners. Treat others with respect and set clear boundaries with those who exhibit abusive behavior.

7. Practice forgiveness and avoid being overly punitive when others make mistakes. Make a conscious effort to forgive when it is appropriate.

8. Allow others to gradually get closer to you. Start by building emotional and communicative closeness, using the assertion skills you have learned.

9. Resist the urge to keep a tally of the ways people have hurt you. Avoid gathering evidence and keeping score, as it only perpetuates negative emotions.

10. Avoid testing others to see if they can be trusted. Instead, focus on building trust gradually and organically.

11. Refrain from taking advantage of others. Remember that treating people with kindness and respect increases the likelihood of receiving the same treatment in return.

12. Make a list of traumas that involved abuse. If it feels too overwhelming, consider discussing it with a therapist who can assist you in creating the list. Work towards reducing the negative emotions and self-perceptions associated with these memories.
