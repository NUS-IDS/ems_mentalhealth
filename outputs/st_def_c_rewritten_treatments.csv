train/717.txt,"My relationship feels off and I feel insecure  My girlfriend's grandma passed away 5 months ago. They were very close. She took care of her till she died. Things kinda returned to normal few weeks later. Last month it feels like we hit a brick wall. Intimacy fell off. I asked what's up. She says she can't connect with anyone and that it's not me. She used to be very open and expressive. Now she gives short answers and has no interest in sex or any touching. When we did have sex in the last month, something felt really off. Now I'm very insecure about us and have thoughts of her cheating. She says otherwise, but I don't know. It just feels like something is really off.",1,"I'm sorry to hear that you're going through a difficult time in your relationship. It sounds like your girlfriend is going through a tough time after the loss of her grandmother, and it's understandable that she may be feeling disconnected and struggling to connect with others. It's important to remember that her behavior is likely a result of her grieving process and not a reflection of her feelings towards you.

It's completely normal to feel insecure and have doubts during times of uncertainty in a relationship, but it's important to communicate openly and honestly with your girlfriend about your feelings. It's also important to give her the space and support she needs to work through her grief in her own time.

I would recommend seeking couples counseling or individual therapy to help navigate through this challenging time in your relationship. A therapist can provide guidance and support as you both work through your emotions and find ways to reconnect with each other. Remember to be patient and understanding with each other as you navigate through this difficult time together."
train/718.txt,My ex-boyfriend and I broke up about 3 months ago and now he wants me back  I'm currently dating someone else and I really like him. But I love and miss my ex so much. What do I do?,2,"Finding the right person is a tricky thing to do. Why did you and your ex break up 3 months ago? In relationships with others you get to see a reflection of yourself. Sometimes you may enjoy that reflection, other times it may not feel so good. I'm not sure where you are in your life and relationships and what you do from here depends on what you desire more of in your life. But I'm not simply talking in the moment desire, I'm referring to the direction you want your life to go. If one of these guys was to support you...who would help you reach your dreams? And who would you enjoy spending time with? It's complicated and no one can answer the 'what to do' question but you. Slow down. Tune into your heart. Listen."
train/382.txt,Should we put off kids until my husband is mentally cured?  My boyfriend is seeking therapy. He is in his 40s and has some childhood issues. He has kids from his previous ex-wife and is unable to see them.,0,"Response: 

It's understandable to have concerns about starting a family when your partner is working through mental health issues. It's important to prioritize your husband's well-being and ensure he has the support he needs to heal from his childhood trauma. It's great that he is seeking therapy to address these issues.

In the meantime, it may be helpful for both of you to brainstorm solutions and strategies to prevent any negative experiences from happening again in the future. Remember that past experiences, whether within or outside of our control, do not dictate our future. It's important to stay optimistic and focus on creating a positive and healthy environment for yourselves and any potential future children.

Creating a list of behaviors that lead to more independence can also be beneficial for both of you as individuals and as a couple. This can help build resilience and empower you to navigate challenges together. Ultimately, the decision to have children should be made when both partners feel emotionally and mentally ready. It may be helpful to continue supporting your husband in his therapy journey and reassess the situation as he progresses in his healing process."

train/286.txt,Why do I have low self-esteem and lack confidence?   I always need alcohol to feel better and use that as a excuse.,0,"I hear that you are struggling with low self-esteem and lack of confidence, and that you are using alcohol as a coping mechanism. It's important to recognize that these feelings may stem from learned behaviors from childhood or past experiences. It's also important to challenge any thoughts you may have about being defective, as these beliefs can contribute to low self-esteem.

It's great that you are seeking help and acknowledging that you are using alcohol as a crutch. I encourage you to take steps to decrease any overcompensating behaviors, such as using alcohol to feel better, and instead focus on building healthier coping mechanisms and self-esteem. Remember that self-esteem and confidence can be improved with time and effort, and seeking support from a mental health counselor can be a great step towards healing and growth. You are not alone in this journey, and there is help available to support you."
train/208.txt,"I have come to the realization that my boyfriend and I want different things  I feel that I need to end my present relationship. He lives three hours away and likes the reassurance of having someone to talk to multiple times per day and seeing me once or twice a month. I want someone who is more present and more of a life companion. Lately, he has had a very busy work schedule and I have only seen him a few times in the last 6 weeks. I told him that I can't continue in this way because I constantly feel frustrated and angry and that he is not making the relationship enough of a priority. I also feel it is keeping me from possibly finding the relationship I want. We have been together 7 years. The problem is that I panic and experience anxiety and depression thinking of him with someone else and then thinking I will never meet someone I like. We have gone through this cycle already 4-5 times and I feel it is unhealthy to stay in it, but my aversion to the anxiety and depression I experience upon separation always leads me to reconcile.",2,"It sounds like you have some insight into the cycle that you describe with your current relationship and at the same time you are still feeling stuck. It also sounds like the distressing feelings that you experience, when you imagine what will happen for you and your current partner, are pretty overwhelming. A competent therapist may be able to help you work through these difficult thoughts and feelings and find a resolution to this cycle that will feel right to you."
train/151.txt,"When I'm around children I get this intense feeling of paranoia and fear  I'm a male in my early 20s. Lately, my paranoia about being around kids is causing me too breathe heavy and sweat a lot. I then start to act weird because I'm trying to fight my paranoia. This leads to people starring at me because they don't know that I'm suffering from panic attacks and paranoia. They just notice me acting scared around kids and they think I'm a threat because of it.    I'm not a pervert or predator. I would never hurt a kid. I like kids and don't know why I'm so scared to be around them.    I don't understand why I feel like this. Am I a bad person? How do I make this stop?",0,"I'm so sorry to hear that you're struggling with these intense feelings of paranoia and fear around children. It's important to remember that having these feelings does not make you a bad person. It sounds like you may be experiencing some form of anxiety or panic attacks in these situations.

I would encourage you to take a moment to challenge any thoughts you may have about being defective or a threat to children. It's also important to choose partners who truly love and accept you for who you are, and to open up to the people you trust about what you're going through.

I recommend seeking support from a mental health professional who can help you explore these feelings and develop coping strategies to manage them. You deserve to feel safe and comfortable in all situations, and it's okay to seek help in order to achieve that. Remember, you are not alone in this and there is support available to you."
train/153.txt,"Why do I feel anxious and uncomfortable at parties or big social situations? Example would be homecoming? I was at my high school's home football game on Friday, and I left because I felt uncomfortable with all the people there and I just wanted to be by myself. Why is that?",0,"As a mental health counselor, I want to first acknowledge that feeling anxious and uncomfortable in social situations, such as parties or big events like homecoming, is a common experience for many people. It's important to remember that you are not alone in feeling this way.

I encourage you to take a moment to reflect on how alike you are to others who may also be experiencing similar feelings in social settings. It's natural to feel a sense of unease when surrounded by a large group of people, especially if you are more introverted or sensitive to crowds.

It's also important to be aware of any negative thoughts or beliefs you may have about yourself that could be contributing to your discomfort in social situations. These thoughts can hold you back from fully connecting with others and enjoying yourself in these settings.

I suggest identifying specific group situations that you tend to avoid and ranking them based on the level of difficulty you perceive. This can help you gradually expose yourself to these situations and work on building your comfort and confidence in social settings.

Remember, it's okay to take breaks and prioritize your own well-being in social situations. It's important to listen to your own needs and boundaries. If you find yourself feeling overwhelmed or anxious, it's okay to step away and take some time for yourself.

If these feelings persist and impact your daily life, I encourage you to consider seeking support from a mental health professional who can help you explore these feelings further and develop coping strategies to manage social anxiety. You deserve to feel comfortable and"

train/114.txt,"My ex-boyfriend is with someone new, and it hurts  I just got out of a two year relationship. I broke up with my boyfriend because he wasn't showing any affection at all. He was talking to other women and lying about it. It pushed me away and hurt me, but I'm still in love with him. A couple days after our breakup, he was talking to someone new. He told me he wasn't sure if he loved me. I cried for several days, lost my appetite, and couldn't sleep. Our whole relationship was only us. We didn't have friends. It was me and him against the world. We didn't talk to anyone else because we only wanted to talk to each other. We hung out constantly and Skyped to sleep every single night. Then, when I cut myself, we talked on Skype. He cried and told me ""I'm still in love with you, I never stopped loving you,"" and I cried tears of joy. I asked multiple times if he loved me and asked to make sure he wasn't just saying that because of me being so depressed. He promised and assured me he loved me. He came over after that, and we had sex because he wanted to. He went the home that night and told me he didn't love me, and he lied because he was scared. He told me I wasn't attractive, I wasn’t beautiful to him, and that I changed. He also told me he was 100% sure he'd never love me again. I'm still in love with him. Why do I love him? How do I stop? Just knowing that someone else is with him hurts me. That I wasn't good enough and that I'm no longer beautiful hurts me. I think I need a therapist, but don't know if I should.",1,"I am so sorry to hear about the pain you are going through. It sounds like you have been through a lot of emotional turmoil in your relationship with your ex-boyfriend. It is completely normal to still have feelings for someone even after they have hurt you, especially when you have invested so much time and emotion into the relationship.

It is important to remember that your worth and beauty are not defined by someone else's opinion of you. You are valuable and deserving of love just as you are. It is also important to recognize that your ex-boyfriend's actions and words are a reflection of his own issues and insecurities, not a true reflection of who you are as a person.

Seeking therapy can be a helpful way to process your emotions, gain insight into your relationship patterns, and work towards healing and moving forward. A therapist can provide a safe and nonjudgmental space for you to explore your feelings and develop coping strategies to help you navigate this difficult time.

Remember to be gentle with yourself and give yourself time to heal. Surround yourself with supportive friends and family who can offer love and encouragement. You deserve to be with someone who treats you with respect and kindness. You are not alone in this journey, and there is hope for a brighter future ahead."

When I look people in the eyes I have voices that tell me to hurt them and if I don't stop looking at who I am talking to it gets so loud I can't hear what they are saying.

I've fought depression and won; however, stress and anxiety are killing me. I feel that my friends don't listen to me. I know they have their own problems, which I do my best to help with.

train/282.txt,"How do I save my marriage?  What am I doing wrong? My wife and I are fighting all the time. What can I do? We don't agree on anything and she usually jumps to conclusions, which are usually wrong on how I feel. She is very family-oriented while all of my family left me on my butt, abused, ignored and messed up with me mentally. I'm not a family-oriented person. I only have two people in my life - my best friend and my wife.    My mother forced my father out of my life so I do not know who he really is. We've gotten in contact but he just makes comments on how much I look like her when in fact I look more like him. This makes me mad because I don't want to look like my mother. I hate her. All that she did was bring me down and make me homeless, which she was successful at. I need guidance in my life. I don't want to lose my wife but we need to have a space because we usually hit each other and it's not healthy. I'm dying to make our relationship healthy. I've never wanted anything more than this. Please help me. I need your advice.",2,"Hello. It sounds to me like you are carrying an enormous amount of emotional weight, and maybe even an equally enormous amount of guilt and feelings of failure about your marriage. I cannot imagine how challenging this is for you right now. Marriages take lots of work, and often the only examples we tend to have are of those we saw when we were young - good, bad, or indifferent. There are no easy answers to your questions, and I won't presume that my response to you will be the linch-pin that heals all your pain. But I can maybe give some thoughts and reflections. First and foremost, cut yourself some slack. No one is perfect. We fail more often than we succeed, but in the end we learn, and that learning helps us grow. Yes, you're right, the abusive aspects of your marriage are not good, and need to stop. You probably are doing more harm than good in that regard, and this will quickly destroy anything you have in your marriage that is even remotely in your favor. Seeing a therapist for yourself, and then seeing a therapist as a couple is a good approach. You have issues that you need to resolve, that, while they impact your marriage because they are part of the history of your life, they are separate from your marriage in many respects.Joining a marriage support group can also be helpful. You can find these through local counseling resources. Sometimes your local crisis numbers can provide services in your area that can be helpful. If you belong to a religious or spiritual community, then you might see if there is any type of counseling offered for free or at a reduced rate. Sometimes pastoral support is focused on the spiritual side of any issues addressed, so if you feel this is important it might be a viable option for you.Lastly, parents are imperfect. Yep...its true. They had no more of a guaranteed parenting success manual than you do at having chances for a perfect marriage. We limp along and do our best. Having said that, we can still take the best from our past and apply to our future, no matter how small or insignificant it might be for us. The bad stuff serves as lessons of what to avoid, and we are each responsible and accountable for our actions in this life. Both with ourselves, and toward other people. So this becomes a guiding principle in our actions. It may be that you discover that the marriage you are in is not a good fit.  I am sure that remains to be seen, but either way you both must be involved in saving it. If only one of you cares, then 100% of the energy to salvage the marriage rests on the shoulders of one person. That's not fair. So be sure you have a clear understanding from your wife about what she wants, and work to create an amicable solution. All of this said, seek out supportive friends, and actively work to do your part to make the changes you want to see in your life. One way or the other, you will benefit from it.Be well."

Why is that?",1,"I'm sorry to hear that you're feeling anxious and uncomfortable in social situations like parties or big events like homecoming. It's completely normal to feel overwhelmed in crowded or unfamiliar settings, especially if you're someone who values alone time and quiet moments. It's important to remember that everyone experiences social anxiety differently, and it's okay to prioritize your own well-being by taking breaks or stepping away when you need to.

It might be helpful to explore why these situations trigger anxiety for you. Are there specific aspects of parties or large gatherings that make you feel uncomfortable? Are there any past experiences or underlying concerns that could be contributing to these feelings? Talking to a therapist or counselor could help you explore these questions and develop coping strategies to navigate social situations more comfortably.

Remember, it's okay to prioritize your mental health and well-being, even if it means stepping away from a social event. Take care of yourself and don't hesitate to reach out for support if you need it."

train/296.txt,Am I going to be alone forever?  I feel like I'm trying to convince myself that I'm okay when I'm not. I'm always blocking out the bad things and forgetting. I also feel like nobody cares for me and they never will. I feel truly alone.,2,"I can relate! When things are going badly, I feel like my life has always been and will always be that way. (But I also do this when things are going well. That is, I forget how good things can turn bad. Personally, to avoid this emotional roller-coaster, I try and heed the famous advice by author and feminist Rita Mae Brown: ""One of the keys to happiness is a bad memory.""So maybe this weakness of your for forgetting is really a strength! It sounds a lot like living in the moment to me. And while it’s hard to manage my past and my future, the moment seems like a small enough piece of temporal real estate to sort out. So that’s the “what” of my answer. The “how” goes like this: Choose one from column A, two from column B, and three from column C in the following chart. Then try doing them for as long as you can. Then see what happens.A                                            B                                                  CGratitude                                Forgiveness                                 AppreciationExpectations                           Meditation                                    ExerciseBitterness                               Distraction                                    Volunteering Resentment                            Substances                                  WorryRegret                                    Possessions                                 PessimismShame                                    Desire                                          SuperstitionRage                                      Isolation                                        WishingSelf-loathing                           Criticism                                       Withholding If you feel as though what you think and believe are out of your control, or that your values were imposed on you, or that nothing good will ever happen again, then we will have to respectfully disagree. You’ve ask a very deep and insightful question, proving that your hope has gotten you this far. Hang onto that hope because I’m an example of things working out despite my previous way of looking at my life.Instead of “convincing” yourself that you’re okay when you’re not, how about calling it “accepting yourself as okay just the way you are, without judging your okayness.” You probably have high standards (perfectionism?) and that’s a thing to talk with a counselor about. The opposite of perfect is not horrible. It’s called “good enough.”Blocking out the bad things and forgetting is as natural as eating and sleeping. All the other mammals do it (except when it comes to life-threatening bad things) so why shouldn’t we? This might be called optimism. Feeling alone and uncared for is a worse feeling than being despised. This is good! This means (I suppose) that you don’t despise yourself as much as you just don’t care for you (because we can often project our own self-beliefs onto others). This is an abstract concept that will take some time to get used to. But I have a suspicion that, with just a little more self-care, and a little more caring for others, you might be better off very soon."

It's important to recognize that these feelings of defectiveness often stem from critical words or experiences from others that have impacted your self-esteem. It's great that you're reaching out for support by sharing your feelings here.

Opening up to people you trust can be a helpful way to work through these feelings of insecurity. Talking to someone who cares about you and understands what you're going through can provide comfort and validation.

It's also important to explore different techniques to manage anxiety during social situations. This could include deep breathing exercises, mindfulness techniques, or seeking professional help from a mental health counselor.

train/382.txt,Should we put off kids until my husband is mentally cured?  My boyfriend is seeking therapy. He is in his 40s and has some childhood issues. He has kids from his previous ex-wife and is unable to see them.,2,"Probably the more important questions to answer concern how much confidence you have in you and your boyfriend becoming parents, how you each feel about the influence of his being banned from seeing his current children, and be clear about the circumstances that led up to the decision of him not being permitted to see his kids.Don't allow some random professional to pronounce your boyfriend as cured.  A relatively qualified therapist would never make this call.Psychological and emotional tensions emerge from our relationships within families.  You and your boyfriend are in a position to set a strong foundation for having children, assuming each of you wants children.Childhood issues, your boyfriend's, anyone's, are more likely to go away when new patterns of interacting emerge.If the two of you are engaged in setting a secure relationship as future parents, the disappointments and hurt from the very early years, will be replaced by better ways of interacting."
train/302.txt,"How can I get over my ex-boyfriend cheating on me?  It's been almost a year since my ex-boyfriend broke up with me after he cheated on me many times. I had found out about a month before, but I hadn't told him I knew because I didn't want us to break up. I used to have very low self-esteem, and I think it might have to do with my dad being an alcoholic. My father cheated on my mother when I was little. I wonder if this pain has to do with that. My ex-boyfriend and I were only dating for five months, but I still can't get over this betrayal. I'm not sure what to feel to get over it: forgiveness? Hate? He helped me financially after our break up by lending me $3000, so I'm grateful for that. I still hate him for what he did and still want him to like me although we're not even talking anymore. We follow each other on Instagram and that's it. I feel like I still need his validation. This is haunting me day and night. I want to focus on my new relationship and goals, but I keep obsessing over this and keep checking my ex-boyfriend's Instagram and Facebook. I feel so bad and keep having nightmares.",0,"I am so sorry to hear about the pain and betrayal you are experiencing after your ex-boyfriend cheated on you. It is completely understandable that this situation would bring up feelings of low self-esteem and past trauma related to your father's infidelity. It's important to seek support and encouragement for expressing your feelings, instead of holding them back. It may be helpful to explore these underlying issues with a therapist who can help you work through them.

But your ""alarm system"" is out of whack and you are spending too much time worrying about how you come across. As you age you understand this more, and it's true...that other people really aren't thinking about you much or monitoring you at all; they're too busy having the same thoughts you're having! Am I good enough? Do people like me, judge me...think I'm weird? We're all concerned about how we come across far more than how others come across. Like many people, you lack compassion for yourself, acceptance of yourself and confidence in yourself. My gut says that these things came from somewhere in your past. Our sensitivities usually come from (as well as genetics) a specific time in our life when we experienced or felt something that was overwhelming and we end up with an alarm system that overreacts at times. Without more details, it's difficult to go further here. I recommend you see a therapist who does cognitive behavioural therapy, which can help you understand the roots of your fears and learn how to manage them more successfully."

I told him that I can't continue in this way because I constantly feel frustrated and angry and that he is not making the relationship enough of a priority. I also feel it is keeping me from possibly finding the relationship I want. We have been together 7 years.

I encourage you to take a moment to think about whether your worries about expressing your needs and feelings to your boyfriend are blown out of proportion.

It's also important to consider whether you were ever treated as a ""parentified child,"" where adults placed adult responsibilities on you during your childhood, which may be impacting how you navigate relationships now.

As you said, these are intrusive and unwanted thoughts - not genuine desires to harm them. This is a form of OCD we often call Harm or Pedophilic OCD. What you are describing here as ""paranoia"" sounds similar to this, and is so demoralizing because you are dealing both with the distress of these unwanted thoughts and feelings, as well as the fear and uncertainty about your own character as a good person.If this is really what is going on (further assessment by the right professional would determine this), the current gold standard approach to addressing OCD is Exposure with Response Prevention - in this case, confronting the feared situations, thoughts or images on purpose, rather than avoiding them, until they lose the fear and shame associated with them."
