"train/120.txt","I don't believe in myself anymore  I was married to a narcissist sociopath for 10 years. During that time I was a general manager. I used to help him financially and in other ways when we were together. But things began to change. He emotionally and sexually drained me. I lost my spirit. I used to be a very happy person but now I am a loner. I left him and moved to another state. Currently, I'm working as a server which makes me believe less in myself. I feel pity for myself a lot but don't know what to do. When I have money problems, he does not help me. He actually enjoys seeing me have a hard time in my life. I need help.","0","I am so sorry to hear about the difficult experiences you have been through with your ex-husband. It sounds like you have been through a lot of emotional and financial strain, and it's completely understandable that you are feeling lost and unsure of yourself right now. 

It's important to remember that your worth and value are not defined by your past experiences or your current job as a server. It's great that you were able to recognize the toxic relationship you were in and make the brave decision to leave. 

As you work on rebuilding your self-esteem and sense of self-worth, it may be helpful to challenge the emotional deprivation schema by seeking out supportive and caring environments where you can have your emotional needs met. Surround yourself with good quality partners and friends who uplift and support you. 

Remember to be gentle with yourself and avoid responding to feelings of deprivation with anger or self-questioning. It's okay to feel pity for yourself, but try to focus on self-compassion and self-care instead. Consider seeking out a therapist or counselor who can help you work through your past experiences and support you in building a healthier relationship with yourself. You deserve to feel happy and fulfilled, and there is hope for a brighter future ahead."
"train/123.txt","I hate talking to people much less strangers  My doctor thinks that seeing a psychiatrist will help with my depression and anxiety. Now my anxiety is worse, what do I do? Writing on here has taken every bit of strength I have left.","0","I'm sorry to hear that you're struggling with anxiety and depression. It's understandable that talking to strangers or even friends can be difficult when you're feeling this way. It's important to remember that seeking help from a mental health professional, like a psychiatrist, is a brave step towards healing.

In therapy, you can work on building trust with your therapist and exploring ways to address and cope with your anxiety and depression. It's also important to learn healthy ways to express and manage your emotions, such as proper assertion skills for venting anger or other strong feelings.

Additionally, surrounding yourself with supportive and non-abusive friends and partners can also make a positive impact on your mental health. Remember that you deserve to have relationships that are healthy and respectful.

I encourage you to continue reaching out for support, whether it's through therapy, support groups, or online forums like this one. You are not alone in your struggles, and there are people who care about your well-being. Take care of yourself and remember to be gentle with yourself during this challenging time."
"train/286.txt","Why do I have low self-esteem and lack confidence?   I always need alcohol to feel better and use that as a excuse.","0","I'm sorry to hear that you are struggling with low self-esteem and lack of confidence. It's important to remember that these feelings are not a reflection of your worth as a person. It may be helpful to challenge the idea that you are defective by examining the evidence for and against personal defectiveness. Additionally, it's important to recognize that any flaws or behaviors you may have learned in childhood can be changed with effort and support. 

Using alcohol as a coping mechanism is common, but it's important to address the underlying issues that may be contributing to your low self-esteem and lack of confidence. Choosing relationships that are supportive rather than critical can also be helpful in building your self-esteem and confidence. Remember, you are not alone in this journey and seeking help from a mental health counselor or therapist can provide you with the support and tools you need to work through these challenges."
"train/289.txt","Why am I so nervous talking to people? Whether it's to a guy or girl, I always feel insecure talking, and I am afraid of embarrassing myself and not being good enough. Even when I am walking, I worry about my appearance and facial expression and such.","2","Hi. I'm glad you wrote, because I think a lot of people have this same issue (to different degrees) and we don't talk about it much. You have some social anxiety that is a bit beyond what the average person might feel. Most people have some amount of worry about what others might think of them, and this probably prevents us from making complete fools of ourselves so that's a good thing. But your ""alarm system"" is out of whack and you are spending too much time worrying about how you come across. As you age you understand this more, and it's true...that other people really aren't thinking about you much or monitoring you at all; they're too busy having the same thoughts you're having! Am I good enough? Do people like me, judge me...think I'm weird? We're all concerned about how we come across far more than how others come across. Like many people, you lack compassion for yourself, acceptance of yourself and confidence in yourself.Â My gut says that these things came from somewhere in your past. Our sensitivities usually come from (as well as genetics) a specific time in our life when we experienced or felt something that was overwhelming and we end up with an alarm system that overreacts at times. Without more details, it's difficult to go further here. I recommend you see a therapist who does cognitive behavioural therapy, which can help you understand the roots of your fears and learn how to manage them more successfully."

It is clear that you have been through a lot and it is completely understandable that you are feeling lost and struggling to believe in yourself.

Leaving a toxic relationship takes a lot of courage and strength, and it sounds like you have already taken a big step in the right direction by moving to another state. It is important to remember that healing from a toxic relationship takes time, and it is okay to feel lost and unsure of yourself during this process.

It is also completely normal to feel pity for yourself and to struggle with self-esteem after going through such a difficult experience. However, it is important to remember that you are not alone and that there is help available to you. Seeking support from a therapist or counselor can be a valuable tool in helping you heal and rebuild your self-esteem.

Remember, you are not defined by your past experiences or by the actions of your ex-partner. You are a strong and resilient person who deserves to be happy and to believe in yourself. Take small steps towards self-care and self-compassion, and know that you are worthy of love and support. You deserve to live a fulfilling and happy life, and I believe that with time and support, you can find your way back to believing in yourself again."
"train/408.txt","How can I just be happy and not mad all the time?  Everything just makes me upset.","0","I hear that you're struggling with feeling upset and angry a lot of the time. It sounds like you may benefit from challenging your negative thinking patterns and focusing on the positives in your life. One way to do this is to actively seek out warm, empathic, and protective environments where you can get your emotional needs met. It may also be helpful to notice and list how often you have negative or pessimistic thoughts, and work on shifting your focus towards more positive thoughts. Making these changes can have a significant impact on how you feel overall. Remember, it's okay to seek support from a mental health counselor or therapist if you feel overwhelmed by these emotions. You deserve to feel happy and at peace."
"train/373.txt","How do I move on from almost being raped?  At a friend's house, we had some drinks and watched some television. He got up and went to bed. I felt sick.

A friend called me, then I able to leave.","0","I am so sorry to hear about what you experienced. It is completely understandable that you are feeling overwhelmed and unsure of how to move forward. It's important to prioritize your mental health and well-being during this difficult time. 

Using imagery to foresee successful completion of self-control and organization can help you regain a sense of control over your thoughts and emotions. Visualizing yourself feeling safe and empowered can be a powerful tool in overcoming the trauma you have experienced. 

In addition, learning relaxation, meditation, or other anxiety-reducing techniques can help you cope with the stress and anxiety that may come with processing this traumatic event. Taking care of yourself and finding ways to calm your mind and body can be essential in your healing journey. 

Creating a list of behaviors that gradually lead to more independence can also be helpful in rebuilding your sense of autonomy and agency. Setting small, achievable goals for yourself can help you regain a sense of empowerment and control over your life. 

It may also be beneficial to seek support from a mental health professional who can provide you with additional tools and resources to help you navigate this challenging time. Remember, you are not alone and there are people who care about you and want to help you through this. Take care of yourself and reach out for support when you need it."
"train/296.txt","Am I going to be alone forever?  I feel like I'm trying to convince myself that I'm okay when I'm not. I'm always blocking out the bad things and forgetting. I also feel like nobody cares for me and they never will. I feel truly alone.","2","I can relate! When things are going badly, I feel like my life has always been and will always be that way. (But I also do this when things are going well. That is, I forget how good things can turn bad. Personally, to avoid this emotional roller-coaster, I try and heed the famous advice by author and feminist Rita Mae Brown: ""One of the keys to happiness is a bad memory.""So maybe this weakness of your for forgetting is really a strength!

Youâve ask a very deep and insightful question, proving that your hope has gotten you this far. Hang onto that hope because Iâm an example of things working out despite my previous way of looking at my life.Instead of âconvincingâ yourself that youâre okay when youâre not, how about calling it âaccepting yourself as okay just the way you are, without judging your okayness.â You probably have high standards (perfectionism?) and thatâs a thing to talk with a counselor about. The opposite of perfect is not horrible. Itâs called âgood enough.âBlocking out the bad things and forgetting is as natural as eating and sleeping. All the other mammals do it (except when it comes to life-threatening bad things) so why shouldnât we? This might be called optimism. Feeling alone and uncared for is a worse feeling than being despised. This is good! This means (I suppose) that you donât despise yourself as much as you just donât care for you (because we can often project our own self-beliefs onto others). This is an abstract concept that will take some time to get used to. But I have a suspicion that, with just a little more self-care, and a little more caring for others, you might be better off very soon."

Not a year ago, I had a car accident. Could this experience add more problems?","0","I'm sorry to hear about your struggles with posttraumatic stress disorder from your military experiences. It's understandable that you may be concerned about how the car accident could potentially impact your PTSD symptoms. It's important to recognize and list the long-term consequences of living in fear of potential triggers, such as the lost opportunities for enjoyment and self-exploration. 

However, it's also important to remember times when you have successfully increased your capacity to cope with difficult situations. Using imagery to visualize future success in handling acceptable levels of risk can be a helpful tool in managing your PTSD symptoms.

It's possible that the car accident could add more challenges to your PTSD, as it may have triggered memories or feelings associated with your military experiences. It's important to seek support from a mental health professional to help you process and cope with any additional stress or symptoms that may arise from the accident. Remember, you are not alone in this journey and there are resources available to help you navigate through these challenges."

"train/91.txt","How can I get over my depression and grief? My dad passed away when I was a teenager. I never got any help, and five years later, I feel like I can't handle it anymore.","1","I am so sorry to hear about the loss of your father and the pain you have been carrying for so long. It is completely understandable that you are struggling with depression and grief, especially since you never received any help to process your emotions when he passed away. It takes a lot of courage to reach out for support, and I commend you for taking this step.

In order to begin healing from your depression and grief, I would highly recommend seeking out a mental health counselor or therapist who can provide you with the guidance and support you need. Talking to a professional can help you work through your emotions, develop coping strategies, and find ways to honor your father's memory in a healthy way.

It is also important to remember that healing is a journey and it is okay to take things one step at a time. Be gentle with yourself and allow yourself to feel your emotions without judgment. Surround yourself with supportive loved ones who can provide comfort and understanding during this difficult time.

You are not alone in this, and there is hope for a brighter future ahead. Please know that there are resources and people who care about you and want to help you through this.

"train/151.txt","When I'm around children I get this intense feeling of paranoia and fear  I'm a male in my early 20s. Lately, my paranoia about being around kids is causing me too breathe heavy and sweat a lot. I then start to act weird because I'm trying to fight my paranoia. This leads to people starring at me because they don't know that I'm suffering from panic attacks and paranoia. They just notice me acting scared around kids and they think I'm a threat because of it.    I'm not a pervert or predator. I would never hurt a kid. I like kids and don't know why I'm so scared to be around them.    I don't understand why I feel like this. Am I a bad person? How do I make this stop?","0","I want to first acknowledge how difficult and distressing this experience must be for you. It sounds like you are struggling with intense feelings of paranoia and fear when around children, which is causing you to have panic attacks and act in ways that are drawing attention from others. It's important to challenge the idea that you are a bad person or defective in any way. 

One suggestion I have is to examine and list the evidence for and against your belief of being a bad person. It may also be helpful to recognize that these thoughts of defectiveness are often influenced by the critical language of significant others or past experiences. Additionally, doing a cost-benefit analysis of the unrelenting standards schema may help you gain insight into where these feelings are coming from and how they are impacting your behavior.

It's important to remember that seeking help and support is a courageous step towards understanding and managing these feelings. I encourage you to consider reaching out to a mental health professional who can work with you to explore the root causes of your fear and develop coping strategies to help you feel more at ease around children. You are not alone in this and there is support available to help you navigate through this challenging experience."
"train/114.txt","My ex-boyfriend is with someone new, and it hurts  I just got out of a two year relationship. I broke up with my boyfriend because he wasn't showing any affection at all. He was talking to other women and lying about it. It pushed me away and hurt me, but I'm still in love with him. A couple days after our breakup, he was talking to someone new. He told me he wasn't sure if he loved me. I cried for several days, lost my appetite, and couldn't sleep. Our whole relationship was only us. We didn't have friends. It was me and him against the world. We didn't talk to anyone else because we only wanted to talk to each other. We hung out constantly and Skyped to sleep every single night. Then, when I cut myself, we talked on Skype. He cried and told me ""I'm still in love with you, I never stopped loving you,"" and I cried tears of joy. I asked multiple times if he loved me and asked to make sure he wasn't just saying that because of me being so depressed. He promised and assured me he loved me. He came over after that, and we had sex because he wanted to. He went the home that night and told me he didn't love me, and he lied because he was scared. He told me I wasn't attractive, I wasnât beautiful to him, and that I changed. He also told me he was 100% sure he'd never love me again. I'm still in love with him. Why do I love him? How do I stop? Just knowing that someone else is with him hurts me. That I wasn't good enough and that I'm no longer beautiful hurts me. I think I need a therapist, but don't know if I should.","0","I'm so sorry to hear that you're going through this difficult time. It sounds like you've been through a lot of emotional pain and confusion. It's completely normal to still have feelings for your ex-boyfriend, even though he has hurt you. It's important to remember that his words and actions are a reflection of his own issues and insecurities, not a reflection of your worth or beauty.

It's understandable that knowing he is with someone new is causing you pain, but it's important to challenge any exaggerated thoughts you may have about his new relationship and how it reflects on you. It's also important to take care of yourself during this time of temporary separation. It may be helpful to seek therapy to work through your feelings and learn healthy coping mechanisms. 

Remember that you deserve to be with someone who treats you with love, respect, and honesty. It may take time, but with self-reflection and support, you can heal from this heartbreak and move forward towards healthier, more stable relationships.

It sounds like she may be struggling with her own emotions and processing the loss of her grandmother. It's important to remember that grief can affect people in different ways and for different lengths of time.

In situations like this, it's important to think about a full spectrum of trustworthiness of others. It's also important to be less punitive when other people make mistakes or when their behavior changes. It's possible that your girlfriend is going through a difficult time and may need some space to process her emotions.

I would encourage you to slowly let other people get close to you and try to have open and honest conversations with your girlfriend about how you're feeling. It's important to communicate your concerns and fears in a non-accusatory way, and to listen to her perspective as well. It's also important to seek support for yourself during this challenging time, whether that's through talking to a therapist or counselor, or reaching out to friends and family for support.

It's important to recognize that the issues in your marriage are likely a result of both of your past experiences and how they are currently manifesting in your relationship. It's concerning that you and your wife are hitting each other, as this is not a healthy or safe way to communicate.

I would recommend seeking out individual therapy for yourself to work through the trauma and pain you have experienced in your past. This can help you better understand yourself, your emotions, and how your past is influencing your current relationships.

We don't agree on anything and she usually jumps to conclusions, which are usually wrong on how I feel. She is very family-oriented while all of my family left me on my butt, abused, ignored and messed up with me mentally. I'm not a family-oriented person. I only have two people in my life - my best friend and my wife.    My mother forced my father out of my life so I do not know who he really is. We've gotten in contact but he just makes comments on how much I look like her when in fact I look more like him. This makes me mad because I don't want to look like my mother. I hate her. All that she did was bring me down and make me homeless, which she was successful at. I need guidance in my life. I don't want to lose my wife but we need to have a space because we usually hit each other and it's not healthy. I'm dying to make our relationship healthy. I've never wanted anything more than this. Please help me. I need your advice.","2","Hello. It sounds to me like you are carrying an enormous amount of emotional weight, and maybe even an equally enormous amount of guilt and feelings of failure about your marriage. I cannot imagine how challenging this is for you right now. Marriages take lots of work, and often the only examples we tend to have are of those we saw when we were young - good, bad, or indifferent. There are no easy answers to your questions, and I won't presume that my response to you will be the linch-pin that heals all your pain. But I can maybe give some thoughts and reflections. First and foremost, cut yourself some slack. No one is perfect. We fail more often than we succeed, but in the end we learn, and that learning helps us grow. Yes, you're right, the abusive aspects of your marriage are not good, and need to stop. You probably are doing more harm than good in that regard, and this will quickly destroy anything you have in your marriage that is even remotely in your favor. Seeing a therapist for yourself, and then seeing a therapist as a couple is a good approach. You have issues that you need to resolve, that, while they impact your marriage because they are part of the history of your life, they are separate from your marriage in many respects.Joining a marriage support group can also be helpful. You can find these through local counseling resources. Sometimes your local crisis numbers can provide services in your area that can be helpful. If you belong to a religious or spiritual community, then you might see if there is any type of counseling offered for free or at a reduced rate. Sometimes pastoral support is focused on the spiritual side of any issues addressed, so if you feel this is important it might be a viable option for you.Lastly, parents are imperfect. Yep...its true. They had no more of a guaranteed parenting success manual than you do at having chances for a perfect marriage. We limp along and do our best. Having said that, we can still take the best from our past and apply to our future, no matter how small or insignificant it might be for us. The bad stuff serves as lessons of what to avoid, and we are each responsible and accountable for our actions in this life. Both with ourselves, and toward other people. So this becomes a guiding principle in our actions. It may be that you discover that the marriage you are in is not a good fit. Â I am sure that remains to be seen, but either way you both must be involved in saving it. If only one of you cares, then 100% of the energy to salvage the marriage rests on the shoulders of one person. That's not fair. So be sure you have a clear understanding from your wife about what she wants, and work to create an amicable solution. All of this said, seek out supportive friends, and actively work to do your part to make the changes you want to see in your life. One way or the other, you will benefit from it.Be well."

"train/302.txt","How can I get over my ex-boyfriend cheating on me?  It's been almost a year since my ex-boyfriend broke up with me after he cheated on me many times. I had found out about a month before, but I hadn't told him I knew because I didn't want us to break up. I used to have very low self-esteem, and I think it might have to do with my dad being an alcoholic. My father cheated on my mother when I was little. I wonder if this pain has to do with that. My ex-boyfriend and I were only dating for five months, but I still can't get over this betrayal. I'm not sure what to feel to get over it: forgiveness? Hate? He helped me financially after our break up by lending me $3000, so I'm grateful for that. I still hate him for what he did and still want him to like me although we're not even talking anymore. We follow each other on Instagram and that's it. I feel like I still need his validation. This is haunting me day and night. I want to focus on my new relationship and goals, but I keep obsessing over this and keep checking my ex-boyfriend's Instagram and Facebook. I feel so bad and keep having nightmares.","0","I'm so sorry to hear about what you've been through with your ex-boyfriend cheating on you. It's completely understandable that you're struggling to move on from such a betrayal, especially given your past experiences with your father's infidelity. It sounds like there is a lot of pain and unresolved emotions that you're carrying with you.

It's important to acknowledge and validate your feelings, whether that be forgiveness, hate, or a mix of both. It might be helpful to explore these feelings further through imagery or writing exercises, as well as learning proper assertion skills to appropriately vent your anger and other strong emotions.

In terms of seeking validation from your ex-boyfriend, it's important to remember that your worth and value are not dependent on his approval. It might be beneficial to consider setting boundaries with him, such as unfollowing him on social media to help you focus on your own healing and growth.

It's also important to prioritize self-care and focus on your new relationship and goals. Seeking support from a therapist or counselor can also be helpful in processing your emotions and working through the pain of betrayal. Remember, healing takes time and it's okay to seek help along the way. You deserve to prioritize your own well-being and happiness."

It's possible that her behavior is not related to you or your relationship, but rather her own internal struggles with grief and loss.

It's important to remember that these feelings of insecurity and fear of not being good enough are common, and you are not alone in experiencing them. One way to challenge the idea that you are defective is to examine and list the evidence for and against personal defectiveness. It can be helpful to identify any negative thoughts or beliefs you have about yourself and work on reframing them in a more positive light.

Additionally, learning social skills training can be beneficial for successful interpersonal and group interaction. This can help you feel more confident and comfortable when talking to others. Gradually spending more time with people can also help desensitize you to social situations and build your confidence over time.

Remember, it's okay to feel nervous, but it's also important to work on building your self-esteem and developing strategies to cope with these feelings. You deserve to feel comfortable and confident in social situations, and seeking support from a mental health counselor or therapist can also be helpful in addressing these concerns. Take care."
"train/46.txt","How can I get people to listen?  I've never been able to talk with my parents. My parents are in their sixties while I am a teenager. I love both of them but not their personalities. I feel that they do not take me seriously whenever I talk about a serious event in my life. If my dad doesnât believe me, then my mom goes along with my dad and acts like she doesnât believe me either. Iâm a pansexual, but I canât trust my own parents.  I've fought depression and won; however, stress and anxiety are killing me. I feel that my friends don't listen to me. I know they have their own problems, which I do my best to help with. But they don't always try to help me with mine, when I really need them. I feel as if my childhood has been taken from me. I feel as if I have no one whom I can trust.","2","First of all, I am sorry that you have been missing out on your childhood. It may help you to know that many of us feel that we have missed out on our childhoods, as well, and that despite such deprivations, for many of us, our adult lives have been extraordinarily fulfilling due to our opening up to trusted adults. I recommend that you find a trustworthy adult to talk to. This may be a teacher, a coach, a school counselor, a minister, a family member, or a friend's family member. If none of these are available, try out a professional counselor, social worker, psychiatric nurse practitioner, psychologist, or a psychiatrist. It is best to get a referral for such a professional from a peer who has had a positive and safe experience with a particular provider."
