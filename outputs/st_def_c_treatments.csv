"train/120.txt","I don't believe in myself anymore  I was married to a narcissist sociopath for 10 years. During that time I was a general manager. I used to help him financially and in other ways when we were together. But things began to change. He emotionally and sexually drained me. I lost my spirit. I used to be a very happy person but now I am a loner. I left him and moved to another state. Currently, I'm working as a server which makes me believe less in myself. I feel pity for myself a lot but don't know what to do. When I have money problems, he does not help me. He actually enjoys seeing me have a hard time in my life. I need help.","0","I am so sorry to hear about the difficult experiences you have been through with your ex-husband. It sounds like you have been through a lot of emotional and financial strain, and it's completely understandable that you are feeling lost and unsure of yourself right now. 

It's important to remember that your worth and value are not defined by your past experiences or your current job as a server. It's great that you were able to recognize the toxic relationship you were in and make the brave decision to leave. 

As you work on rebuilding your self-esteem and sense of self-worth, it may be helpful to challenge the emotional deprivation schema by seeking out supportive and caring environments where you can have your emotional needs met. Surround yourself with good quality partners and friends who uplift and support you. 

Remember to be gentle with yourself and avoid responding to feelings of deprivation with anger or self-questioning. It's okay to feel pity for yourself, but try to focus on self-compassion and self-care instead. Consider seeking out a therapist or counselor who can help you work through your past experiences and support you in building a healthier relationship with yourself. You deserve to feel happy and fulfilled, and there is hope for a brighter future ahead."
"train/123.txt","I hate talking to people much less strangers  My doctor thinks that seeing a psychiatrist will help with my depression and anxiety. Now my anxiety is worse, what do I do? Writing on here has taken every bit of strength I have left.","0","I'm sorry to hear that you're struggling with anxiety and depression. It's understandable that talking to strangers or even friends can be difficult when you're feeling this way. It's important to remember that seeking help from a mental health professional, like a psychiatrist, is a brave step towards healing.

In therapy, you can work on building trust with your therapist and exploring ways to address and cope with your anxiety and depression. It's also important to learn healthy ways to express and manage your emotions, such as proper assertion skills for venting anger or other strong feelings.

Additionally, surrounding yourself with supportive and non-abusive friends and partners can also make a positive impact on your mental health. Remember that you deserve to have relationships that are healthy and respectful.

I encourage you to continue reaching out for support, whether it's through therapy, support groups, or online forums like this one. You are not alone in your struggles, and there are people who care about your well-being. Take care of yourself and remember to be gentle with yourself during this challenging time."
"train/286.txt","Why do I have low self-esteem and lack confidence?   I always need alcohol to feel better and use that as a excuse.","0","I'm sorry to hear that you are struggling with low self-esteem and lack of confidence. It's important to remember that these feelings are not a reflection of your worth as a person. It may be helpful to challenge the idea that you are defective by examining the evidence for and against personal defectiveness. Additionally, it's important to recognize that any flaws or behaviors you may have learned in childhood can be changed with effort and support. 

Using alcohol as a coping mechanism is common, but it's important to address the underlying issues that may be contributing to your low self-esteem and lack of confidence. Choosing relationships that are supportive rather than critical can also be helpful in building your self-esteem and confidence. Remember, you are not alone in this journey and seeking help from a mental health counselor or therapist can provide you with the support and tools you need to work through these challenges."
"train/289.txt","Why am I so nervous talking to people? Whether it's to a guy or girl, I always feel insecure talking, and I am afraid of embarrassing myself and not being good enough. Even when I am walking, I worry about my appearance and facial expression and such.","2","Hi. I'm glad you wrote, because I think a lot of people have this same issue (to different degrees) and we don't talk about it much. You have some social anxiety that is a bit beyond what the average person might feel. Most people have some amount of worry about what others might think of them, and this probably prevents us from making complete fools of ourselves so that's a good thing. But your ""alarm system"" is out of whack and you are spending too much time worrying about how you come across. As you age you understand this more, and it's true...that other people really aren't thinking about you much or monitoring you at all; they're too busy having the same thoughts you're having! Am I good enough? Do people like me, judge me...think I'm weird? We're all concerned about how we come across far more than how others come across. Like many people, you lack compassion for yourself, acceptance of yourself and confidence in yourself. My gut says that these things came from somewhere in your past. Our sensitivities usually come from (as well as genetics) a specific time in our life when we experienced or felt something that was overwhelming and we end up with an alarm system that overreacts at times. Without more details, it's difficult to go further here. I recommend you see a therapist who does cognitive behavioural therapy, which can help you understand the roots of your fears and learn how to manage them more successfully."

It is clear that you have been through a lot and it is completely understandable that you are feeling lost and struggling to believe in yourself.

Leaving a toxic relationship takes a lot of courage and strength, and it sounds like you have already taken a big step in the right direction by moving to another state. It is important to remember that healing from a toxic relationship takes time, and it is okay to feel lost and unsure of yourself during this process.

It is also completely normal to feel pity for yourself and to struggle with self-esteem after going through such a difficult experience. However, it is important to remember that you are not alone and that there is help available to you. Seeking support from a therapist or counselor can be a valuable tool in helping you heal and rebuild your self-esteem.

Remember, you are not defined by your past experiences or by the actions of your ex-partner. You are a strong and resilient person who deserves to be happy and to believe in yourself. Take small steps towards self-care and self-compassion, and know that you are worthy of love and support. You deserve to live a fulfilling and happy life, and I believe that with time and support, you can find your way back to believing in yourself again."
"train/408.txt","How can I just be happy and not mad all the time?  Everything just makes me upset.","0","I hear that you're struggling with feeling upset and angry a lot of the time. It sounds like you may benefit from challenging your negative thinking patterns and focusing on the positives in your life. One way to do this is to actively seek out warm, empathic, and protective environments where you can get your emotional needs met. It may also be helpful to notice and list how often you have negative or pessimistic thoughts, and work on shifting your focus towards more positive thoughts. Making these changes can have a significant impact on how you feel overall. Remember, it's okay to seek support from a mental health counselor or therapist if you feel overwhelmed by these emotions. You deserve to feel happy and at peace."
"train/373.txt","How do I move on from almost being raped?  At a friend's house, we had some drinks and watched some television. He got up and went to bed. I felt sick. He came out to see if I was okay, and I said no. I said I wanted to go home, and he told me to come lay down. As I laid down on the bed, he started touching me. A friend called me, then I able to leave.","0","I am so sorry to hear about what you experienced. It is completely understandable that you are feeling overwhelmed and unsure of how to move forward. It's important to prioritize your mental health and well-being during this difficult time. 

Using imagery to foresee successful completion of self-control and organization can help you regain a sense of control over your thoughts and emotions. Visualizing yourself feeling safe and empowered can be a powerful tool in overcoming the trauma you have experienced. 

In addition, learning relaxation, meditation, or other anxiety-reducing techniques can help you cope with the stress and anxiety that may come with processing this traumatic event. Taking care of yourself and finding ways to calm your mind and body can be essential in your healing journey. 

Creating a list of behaviors that gradually lead to more independence can also be helpful in rebuilding your sense of autonomy and agency. Setting small, achievable goals for yourself can help you regain a sense of empowerment and control over your life. 

It may also be beneficial to seek support from a mental health professional who can provide you with additional tools and resources to help you navigate this challenging time. Remember, you are not alone and there are people who care about you and want to help you through this. Take care of yourself and reach out for support when you need it."
"train/296.txt","Am I going to be alone forever?  I feel like I'm trying to convince myself that I'm okay when I'm not. I'm always blocking out the bad things and forgetting. I also feel like nobody cares for me and they never will. I feel truly alone.","2","I can relate! When things are going badly, I feel like my life has always been and will always be that way. (But I also do this when things are going well. That is, I forget how good things can turn bad. Personally, to avoid this emotional roller-coaster, I try and heed the famous advice by author and feminist Rita Mae Brown: ""One of the keys to happiness is a bad memory.""So maybe this weakness of your for forgetting is really a strength! It sounds a lot like living in the moment to me. And while it’s hard to manage my past and my future, the moment seems like a small enough piece of temporal real estate to sort out. So that’s the “what” of my answer. The “how” goes like this: Choose one from column A, two from column B, and three from column C in the following chart. Then try doing them for as long as you can. Then see what happens.A                                            B                                                  CGratitude                                Forgiveness                                 AppreciationExpectations                           Meditation                                    ExerciseBitterness                               Distraction                                    Volunteering Resentment                            Substances                                  WorryRegret                                    Possessions                                 PessimismShame                                    Desire                                          SuperstitionRage                                      Isolation                                        WishingSelf-loathing                           Criticism                                       Withholding If you feel as though what you think and believe are out of your control, or that your values were imposed on you, or that nothing good will ever happen again, then we will have to respectfully disagree. You’ve ask a very deep and insightful question, proving that your hope has gotten you this far. Hang onto that hope because I’m an example of things working out despite my previous way of looking at my life.Instead of “convincing” yourself that you’re okay when you’re not, how about calling it “accepting yourself as okay just the way you are, without judging your okayness.” You probably have high standards (perfectionism?) and that’s a thing to talk with a counselor about. The opposite of perfect is not horrible. It’s called “good enough.”Blocking out the bad things and forgetting is as natural as eating and sleeping. All the other mammals do it (except when it comes to life-threatening bad things) so why shouldn’t we? This might be called optimism. Feeling alone and uncared for is a worse feeling than being despised. This is good! This means (I suppose) that you don’t despise yourself as much as you just don’t care for you (because we can often project our own self-beliefs onto others). This is an abstract concept that will take some time to get used to. But I have a suspicion that, with just a little more self-care, and a little more caring for others, you might be better off very soon."
"train/365.txt","Could a car accident add more problems to my posttraumatic stress disorder? I have been diagnosed with posttraumatic stress disorder due to my military experiences. Not a year ago, I had a car accident. Could this experience add more problems?","0","I'm sorry to hear about your struggles with posttraumatic stress disorder from your military experiences. It's understandable that you may be concerned about how the car accident could potentially impact your PTSD symptoms. It's important to recognize and list the long-term consequences of living in fear of potential triggers, such as the lost opportunities for enjoyment and self-exploration. 

However, it's also important to remember times when you have successfully increased your capacity to cope with difficult situations. Using imagery to visualize future success in handling acceptable levels of risk can be a helpful tool in managing your PTSD symptoms.

It's possible that the car accident could add more challenges to your PTSD, as it may have triggered memories or feelings associated with your military experiences. It's important to seek support from a mental health professional to help you process and cope with any additional stress or symptoms that may arise from the accident.

Here's a link to a directory of Vet Centers:http://www.va.gov/directory/guide/vetcenter.aspYour service and sacrifice is greatly appreciated."
"train/91.txt","How can I get over my depression and grief? My dad passed away when I was a teenager. I never got any help, and five years later, I feel like I can't handle it anymore.","1","I am so sorry to hear about the loss of your father and the pain you have been carrying for so long. It is completely understandable that you are struggling with depression and grief, especially since you never received any help to process your emotions when he passed away. It takes a lot of courage to reach out for support, and I commend you for taking this step.

In order to begin healing from your depression and grief, I would highly recommend seeking out a mental health counselor or therapist who can provide you with the guidance and support you need. Talking to a professional can help you work through your emotions, develop coping strategies, and find ways to honor your father's memory in a healthy way.

It is also important to remember that healing is a journey and it is okay to take things one step at a time. Be gentle with yourself and allow yourself to feel your emotions without judgment. Surround yourself with supportive loved ones who can provide comfort and understanding during this difficult time.

You are not alone in this, and there is hope for a brighter future ahead. Please know that there are resources and people who care about you and want to help you through this. You deserve to find peace and healing, and I believe that with the right support, you can overcome your depression and grief."
"train/151.txt","When I'm around children I get this intense feeling of paranoia and fear  I'm a male in my early 20s. Lately, my paranoia about being around kids is causing me too breathe heavy and sweat a lot. I then start to act weird because I'm trying to fight my paranoia. This leads to people starring at me because they don't know that I'm suffering from panic attacks and paranoia. They just notice me acting scared around kids and they think I'm a threat because of it.    I'm not a pervert or predator. I would never hurt a kid. I like kids and don't know why I'm so scared to be around them.    I don't understand why I feel like this. Am I a bad person? How do I make this stop?","0","I want to first acknowledge how difficult and distressing this experience must be for you. It sounds like you are struggling with intense feelings of paranoia and fear when around children, which is causing you to have panic attacks and act in ways that are drawing attention from others. It's important to challenge the idea that you are a bad person or defective in any way. 

One suggestion I have is to examine and list the evidence for and against your belief of being a bad person. It may also be helpful to recognize that these thoughts of defectiveness are often influenced by the critical language of significant others or past experiences. Additionally, doing a cost-benefit analysis of the unrelenting standards schema may help you gain insight into where these feelings are coming from and how they are impacting your behavior.

It's important to remember that seeking help and support is a courageous step towards understanding and managing these feelings. I encourage you to consider reaching out to a mental health professional who can work with you to explore the root causes of your fear and develop coping strategies to help you feel more at ease around children. You are not alone in this and there is support available to help you navigate through this challenging experience."
"train/114.txt","My ex-boyfriend is with someone new, and it hurts  I just got out of a two year relationship. I broke up with my boyfriend because he wasn't showing any affection at all. He was talking to other women and lying about it. It pushed me away and hurt me, but I'm still in love with him. A couple days after our breakup, he was talking to someone new. He told me he wasn't sure if he loved me. I cried for several days, lost my appetite, and couldn't sleep. Our whole relationship was only us. We didn't have friends. It was me and him against the world. We didn't talk to anyone else because we only wanted to talk to each other. We hung out constantly and Skyped to sleep every single night. Then, when I cut myself, we talked on Skype. He cried and told me ""I'm still in love with you, I never stopped loving you,"" and I cried tears of joy. I asked multiple times if he loved me and asked to make sure he wasn't just saying that because of me being so depressed. He promised and assured me he loved me. He came over after that, and we had sex because he wanted to. He went the home that night and told me he didn't love me, and he lied because he was scared. He told me I wasn't attractive, I wasn’t beautiful to him, and that I changed. He also told me he was 100% sure he'd never love me again. I'm still in love with him. Why do I love him? How do I stop?

It sounds like you've been through a lot of emotional pain and confusion. It's completely normal to still have feelings for your ex-boyfriend, even though he has hurt you.

It's understandable that knowing he is with someone new is causing you pain, but it's important to challenge any exaggerated thoughts you may have about his new relationship and how it reflects on you. It's also important to take care of yourself during this time of temporary separation. It may be helpful to seek therapy to work through your feelings and learn healthy coping mechanisms. 

Remember that you deserve to be with someone who treats you with love, respect, and honesty.

It's also important to be less punitive when other people make mistakes or when their behavior changes. It's possible that your girlfriend is going through a difficult time and may need some space to process her emotions.

I would encourage you to slowly let other people get close to you and try to have open and honest conversations with your girlfriend about how you're feeling. It's important to communicate your concerns and fears in a non-accusatory way, and to listen to her perspective as well. It's also important to seek support for yourself during this challenging time, whether that's through talking to a therapist or counselor, or reaching out to friends and family for support.

We don't agree on anything and she usually jumps to conclusions, which are usually wrong on how I feel.

The problem is that I panic and experience anxiety and depression thinking of him with someone else and then thinking I will never meet someone I like.

I would encourage you to seek out professional help from a counselor or therapist who can provide you with the support and guidance you need to process your feelings and work through the trauma. It can also be helpful to reach out to a trusted friend or family member for emotional support.

Remember that healing is a process, and it is okay to take things one day at a time. You are not alone, and there are people who care about you and want to help you through this difficult time. Please take care of yourself and prioritize your well-being as you navigate this challenging experience."
"train/114.txt","My ex-boyfriend is with someone new, and it hurts  I just got out of a two year relationship. I broke up with my boyfriend because he wasn't showing any affection at all. He was talking to other women and lying about it. It pushed me away and hurt me, but I'm still in love with him. A couple days after our breakup, he was talking to someone new. He told me he wasn't sure if he loved me. I cried for several days, lost my appetite, and couldn't sleep. Our whole relationship was only us. We didn't have friends. It was me and him against the world. We didn't talk to anyone else because we only wanted to talk to each other. We hung out constantly and Skyped to sleep every single night. Then, when I cut myself, we talked on Skype. He cried and told me ""I'm still in love with you, I never stopped loving you,"" and I cried tears of joy. I asked multiple times if he loved me and asked to make sure he wasn't just saying that because of me being so depressed. He promised and assured me he loved me. He came over after that, and we had sex because he wanted to. He went the home that night and told me he didn't love me, and he lied because he was scared. He told me I wasn't attractive, I wasn’t beautiful to him, and that I changed. He also told me he was 100% sure he'd never love me again. I'm still in love with him. Why do I love him? How do I stop? Just knowing that someone else is with him hurts me. That I wasn't good enough and that I'm no longer beautiful hurts me.

It sounds like you have been through a lot emotionally, and it is completely understandable that you are feeling hurt and confused. It is common to still have feelings for someone even after a breakup, especially when the relationship was as intense and all-consuming as yours was.

It is important to remember that your worth and beauty are not defined by someone else's opinion of you. You deserve to be with someone who treats you with love, respect, and honesty. It is not your fault that your ex-boyfriend was unable to see your worth and appreciate you for who you are.

Seeking therapy could be a helpful step in processing your feelings and moving forward in a healthy way. A therapist can provide you with support, guidance, and coping strategies to help you navigate through this difficult time. It is okay to ask for help and take care of yourself during this challenging period.

Remember to be kind to yourself and give yourself time to heal. You deserve to be happy and to be with someone who truly values and cherishes you. You are not alone in this, and there are people who care about you and want to help you through this. Take care."

He has kids from his previous ex-wife and is unable to see them.","0","I can understand that you may be feeling uncertain about starting a family while your husband is still working through his mental health issues. It's important to prioritize both your husband's well-being and the potential impact on your future children. 

It may be helpful for you and your husband to explore these concerns in therapy together. In the meantime, I would recommend considering the suggestions I provided earlier in terms of managing your own worries and expectations. It's also important to communicate openly with your husband about your concerns and to work together to create a plan that feels right for both of you.

Ultimately, the decision to have children is a personal one that should be made based on what feels right for your relationship and family dynamic. It may be helpful to seek guidance from a therapist or counselor who can support you both through this decision-making process."

This leads to people starring at me because they don't know that I'm suffering from panic attacks and paranoia. They just notice me acting scared around kids and they think I'm a threat because of it.    I'm not a pervert or predator. I would never hurt a kid.

Why is that?","0","I'm sorry to hear that you're feeling anxious and uncomfortable in social situations like parties or big events like homecoming. It's not uncommon for people to feel overwhelmed in crowded and social settings. It's possible that you may benefit from learning social skills training to help with successful interactions with others. Gradually spending more time with people may also help you become more comfortable in social settings over time.

It's important to recognize that thoughts of defectiveness or feeling out of place are often influenced by the critical language of significant others in our lives. It's possible that past experiences or negative feedback from others may be contributing to your feelings of discomfort in social situations.

It's okay to take breaks or step away from overwhelming situations like the football game you mentioned. It's important to prioritize your mental well-being and take care of yourself.

He lives three hours away and likes the reassurance of having someone to talk to multiple times per day and seeing me once or twice a month. I want someone who is more present and more of a life companion. Lately, he has had a very busy work schedule and I have only seen him a few times in the last 6 weeks. I told him that I can't continue in this way because I constantly feel frustrated and angry and that he is not making the relationship enough of a priority. I also feel it is keeping me from possibly finding the relationship I want. We have been together 7 years. The problem is that I panic and experience anxiety and depression thinking of him with someone else and then thinking I will never meet someone I like. We have gone through this cycle already 4-5 times and I feel it is unhealthy to stay in it, but my aversion to the anxiety and depression I experience upon separation always leads me to reconcile.","1","I am sorry to hear that you are going through such a difficult and painful situation. It takes a lot of courage to recognize that you want different things in a relationship and to consider ending it for your own well-being. It is clear that you have put a lot of thought and reflection into this decision, and it is important to prioritize your own needs and happiness.

It is completely normal to feel anxious and depressed when facing the end of a long-term relationship, especially when there is uncertainty about the future. It is important to remember that these feelings are valid and that it is okay to seek support from friends, family, or a mental health professional during this challenging time.

It may be helpful to explore why you keep reconciling with your boyfriend despite feeling frustrated and unfulfilled in the relationship. Are there underlying fears or beliefs that are driving this pattern of behavior? Taking the time to understand your own emotions and motivations can help you make a decision that is truly in line with your own values and desires.

Remember that it is okay to prioritize your own happiness and well-being, even if it means facing temporary discomfort or uncertainty.

"train/282.txt","How do I save my marriage?  What am I doing wrong? My wife and I are fighting all the time. What can I do? We don't agree on anything and she usually jumps to conclusions, which are usually wrong on how I feel. She is very family-oriented while all of my family left me on my butt, abused, ignored and messed up with me mentally. I'm not a family-oriented person. I only have two people in my life - my best friend and my wife.    My mother forced my father out of my life so I do not know who he really is. We've gotten in contact but he just makes comments on how much I look like her when in fact I look more like him. This makes me mad because I don't want to look like my mother. I hate her. All that she did was bring me down and make me homeless, which she was successful at. I need guidance in my life. I don't want to lose my wife but we need to have a space because we usually hit each other and it's not healthy. I'm dying to make our relationship healthy. I've never wanted anything more than this. Please help me. I need your advice.","2","Hello. It sounds to me like you are carrying an enormous amount of emotional weight, and maybe even an equally enormous amount of guilt and feelings of failure about your marriage. I cannot imagine how challenging this is for you right now. Marriages take lots of work, and often the only examples we tend to have are of those we saw when we were young - good, bad, or indifferent. There are no easy answers to your questions, and I won't presume that my response to you will be the linch-pin that heals all your pain. But I can maybe give some thoughts and reflections. First and foremost, cut yourself some slack. No one is perfect. We fail more often than we succeed, but in the end we learn, and that learning helps us grow. Yes, you're right, the abusive aspects of your marriage are not good, and need to stop. You probably are doing more harm than good in that regard, and this will quickly destroy anything you have in your marriage that is even remotely in your favor. Seeing a therapist for yourself, and then seeing a therapist as a couple is a good approach. You have issues that you need to resolve, that, while they impact your marriage because they are part of the history of your life, they are separate from your marriage in many respects.Joining a marriage support group can also be helpful. You can find these through local counseling resources. Sometimes your local crisis numbers can provide services in your area that can be helpful. If you belong to a religious or spiritual community, then you might see if there is any type of counseling offered for free or at a reduced rate. Sometimes pastoral support is focused on the spiritual side of any issues addressed, so if you feel this is important it might be a viable option for you.Lastly, parents are imperfect. Yep...its true. They had no more of a guaranteed parenting success manual than you do at having chances for a perfect marriage. We limp along and do our best. Having said that, we can still take the best from our past and apply to our future, no matter how small or insignificant it might be for us. The bad stuff serves as lessons of what to avoid, and we are each responsible and accountable for our actions in this life. Both with ourselves, and toward other people. So this becomes a guiding principle in our actions. It may be that you discover that the marriage you are in is not a good fit.  I am sure that remains to be seen, but either way you both must be involved in saving it. If only one of you cares, then 100% of the energy to salvage the marriage rests on the shoulders of one person. That's not fair. So be sure you have a clear understanding from your wife about what she wants, and work to create an amicable solution. All of this said, seek out supportive friends, and actively work to do your part to make the changes you want to see in your life. One way or the other, you will benefit from it.Be well."

"train/282.txt","How do I save my marriage?  What am I doing wrong? My wife and I are fighting all the time. What can I do? We don't agree on anything and she usually jumps to conclusions, which are usually wrong on how I feel. She is very family-oriented while all of my family left me on my butt, abused, ignored and messed up with me mentally. I'm not a family-oriented person. I only have two people in my life - my best friend and my wife.    My mother forced my father out of my life so I do not know who he really is. We've gotten in contact but he just makes comments on how much I look like her when in fact I look more like him. This makes me mad because I don't want to look like my mother. I hate her. All that she did was bring me down and make me homeless, which she was successful at. I need guidance in my life. I don't want to lose my wife but we need to have a space because we usually hit each other and it's not healthy. I'm dying to make our relationship healthy. I've never wanted anything more than this.

It is clear that you have been through a lot and that these experiences have had a significant impact on your relationships, including your marriage. It's important to recognize that the way you have been treated in the past can affect how you interact with others in the present.

It sounds like you are really struggling with communication and conflict resolution in your marriage. One suggestion I have for you is to work on developing assertion skills and finding ways to express your needs effectively to your wife. It may also be helpful to seek out therapy or counseling to work through some of the trauma and emotional deprivation you have experienced.

Additionally, creating space in your relationship to work on yourselves individually and then come back together to work on the relationship as a team could be beneficial. It's important to prioritize your own well-being and mental health in order to have a healthy and fulfilling relationship with your wife.

I encourage you to seek support and guidance from a mental health professional who can help you navigate these challenges and work towards creating a healthier and more fulfilling relationship with your wife.

It only goes away when I hurt myself.","0","I'm sorry to hear that you're feeling this way. It sounds like you may have a strong need for validation and approval from others. It's important to remember that you are valuable and worthy just as you are, and that you don't need to constantly seek validation from others. 

One suggestion I have for you is to try identifying and listing your own personal preferences and natural inclinations, rather than always doing what you think others want you to do. This can help you feel more confident in expressing your true self and not feeling the need to constantly seek approval from others. 

Additionally, using time-outs, meditation, and relaxation exercises can help you manage these feelings of emptiness and anxiety when you're not sharing everything with others. These practices can help you connect with yourself and find inner peace without needing external validation.

It's important to communicate openly and honestly with your girlfriend about your feelings and concerns, but also try to approach the situation with empathy and understanding. It's possible that her behavior is not related to you or your relationship, but rather her own internal struggles with grief and loss.

I would encourage you to continue to support and be there for your girlfriend during this difficult time. Encourage her to seek support from a therapist or counselor who can help her navigate her feelings and emotions.

I had found out about a month before, but I hadn't told him I knew because I didn't want us to break up. I used to have very low self-esteem, and I think it might have to do with my dad being an alcoholic. My father cheated on my mother when I was little. I wonder if this pain has to do with that. My ex-boyfriend and I were only dating for five months, but I still can't get over this betrayal. I'm not sure what to feel to get over it: forgiveness? Hate?

One suggestion I have is to track and list the similarities you have with other people. This can help you see that you are not as different or separate from others as you may feel. Additionally, learning social skills training can help you develop successful interpersonal and group interactions, which may help alleviate some of the anxiety and negative thoughts you have about interacting with others.

It's important to remember that these feelings of insecurity and fear of not being good enough are common, and you are not alone in experiencing them. One way to challenge the idea that you are defective is to examine and list the evidence for and against personal defectiveness. It can be helpful to identify any negative thoughts or beliefs you have about yourself and work on reframing them in a more positive light.

Additionally, learning social skills training can be beneficial for successful interpersonal and group interaction. This can help you feel more confident and comfortable when talking to others. Gradually spending more time with people can also help desensitize you to social situations and build your confidence over time.
